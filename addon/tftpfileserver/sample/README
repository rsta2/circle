README

This sample features a TFTP (Trivial file transfer protocol) file server on your
Raspberry Pi. You can put files in the root directory of the boot partition of
the SD card via the network or get files from there.

Its main purpose is to provide a way to update the firmware and kernel images on
the SD card without removing the SD card from Raspberry Pi. If you include the
CTFTPFileServer class into your own application and start the TFTP server task
in the background, you can update your kernel(7).img file after testing the
previous version. This service is intended for development and testing. You
should not enable it in the release version, because otherwise anybody on your
local network could write to your SD card. That's why you should be behind a
network firewall when using TFTP.

After booting and 5 blinks of the Act LED the sample application is waiting for
incoming TFTP requests. You need a TFTP client program on your host computer to
put or get files. The client will be normally executed like this:

	tftp -m binary ipaddress -c put file

"ipaddress" is the IP address of your Raspberry Pi which is shown on its screen.
"file" is the name of the file to be send to the Raspberry Pi (e.g. kernel.img).
Alternatively you can use the "get" command to receive a file from the Raspberry
Pi and save it to the current working directory on your host computer.
