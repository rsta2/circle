This sample uses the OneWire library to control a DS18S20 (or DS18B20)
temperature sensor via the 1-Wire protocol. The data line (DQ) of the DS18x20
has to be connected to the Raspberry Pi via GPIO pin 24. This sample
automatically determines the power mode (parasite / external supply). There is
only another 4.7K resistor required. See the DS18x20 datasheet for details! When
the sample is started it continuously displays the current temperature (after 5
blinks of the Act LED).

The OneWire library was ported from Paul Stoffregen's version
[http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_OneWire.html]. He maintains this library for
several microcontroller platforms. See the notices in OneWire.cpp!
