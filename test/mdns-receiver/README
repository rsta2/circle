README

This test receives mDNS UDP multicast packets on the connected network and
hexdumps them to the logger.

To use this test with a WLAN, you have to define this in the Makefile:

	USE_WLAN = 1

Furthermore the libraries in the following subdirectories must be build
manually, before building this program for WLAN usage:

* addon/SDCard/
* addon/fatfs/
* addon/wlan/
* addon/wlan/hostap/wpa_supplicant/

See addon/wlan/sample/hello_wlan/README for more info on WLAN access.
