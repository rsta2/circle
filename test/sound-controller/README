README

This test program is a command line tool for interactive communication with the
sound controller of sound devices. It can be used via an attached USB keyboard
and a (HDMI) display or via a serial terminal at 115200 Bps connected to
GPIO14/15 of the GPIO header (SoC numbers). The serial interface is
automatically used, if an USB keyboard is not attached.

If you want to use an USB keyboard, you should select your preferred keyboard
map using the file cmdline.txt (e.g. keymap=UK). There are six of these
language-depended maps at the moment (UK English (UK), Spanish (ES), French
(FR), Italian (IT), US International (US) and German (DE)).

It is recommended to enable the system option REALTIME in the file
include/circle/sysconfig.h before build. Some parameters (e.g. WRITE_CHANNELS)
may have to be modified in the file config.h before build.

By default the sample is built without the VCHIQ option, because this requires
additional libraries, which have to be built manually. If you want this VCHIQ
sound support, first enable the line "USE_VCHIQ_SOUND = 1" in the Makefile of
the sample. Then enter the following commands from project root:

	./makeall --nosample
	cd addon/linux
	make
	cd ../vc4
	./makeall
	cd ../../test/sound-controller
	make

The ready built kernel image should be in the current directory then.

After starting the Raspberry Pi you will get a sign-on message and a prompt. You
can now choose a supported command and execute it by pressing ENTER. Multiple
commands can be entered on one line without a special delimiter. The command
execution will be aborted if an error occurs. Please use the "help" command to
get info on all commands.

The program maintains up to two devices, an output and an input device. If only
the output device is active, it is driven from an oscillator, which can generate
sound of different wave-forms. When the input device is active too, the input
sound is transferred to the output device. If only the input device is active,
the input sound data is ignored and can control an VU meter only.

The following example log shows the communication with an USB audio device (on
Raspberry Pi 4 only):
