STDLIB SUPPORT

Circle provides some support for solutions, which allow using C and C++ standard
library features to build bare metal applications. This is configured using the
build option STDLIB_SUPPORT, which can be defined in the files Config.mk or
Rules.mk as follows:

* STDLIB_SUPPORT=-1 for no stdlib management
* STDLIB_SUPPORT=0 to build without external libs (old setting)
* STDLIB_SUPPORT=1 to build with libgcc.a only (default now)
* STDLIB_SUPPORT=2 to build with C standard library (external newlib) too
* STDLIB_SUPPORT=3 to build with C++ standard library too

For the option STDLIB_SUPPORT=-1 Circle doesn't do any automatic standard library
management and requires external implementations of any standard functions used by
Circle and by your application.  Further, the circle build rules don't automatically
link to any of the standard libraries. Basically stdlib support is left completely
to the client application.

For options STDLIB_SUPPORT=0 and STDLIB_SUPPORT=1 Circle links to libgcc.a only and 
includes its own implementations of any stdlib functions it requires that aren't 
included with just libgcc.

Please note that Circle needs support from external projects to implement the
options STDLIB_SUPPORT=2 and STDLIB_SUPPORT=3. This is mainly realized by the
following project (a newlib port for Circle) by Stephan Muehlstrasser:

	https://github.com/smuehlst/circle-stdlib

Circle is included as a Git sub-module into this project, which provides a configure
script and makefiles to build all required libraries (including the
Circle libraries) to use C standard library functions in Circle. The project
contains also specific sample programs, which demonstrate how this support can
be used. Please see the documentation of this project for details!

Some toolchains provide C++ standard library support, which have been build
using newlib, like those which can be downloaded here:

	https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads

With these toolchains and the newlib port by Stephan Muehlstrasser it is
possible, to develop Circle applications, which use the features of the C++
standard library. This is supported by the build.bash script in the
circle-stdlib project too and is the default case. Only if you encounter
problems when building applications (e.g. when building on Raspbian itself), you
can fall back to the C standard library only case using the build.bash option
--no-cpp.


NOTE

With STDLIB_SUPPORT=2 or STDLIB_SUPPORT=3 set, an instance of the class
CMemorySystem will be created in Circle's sysinit() before calling the static
constructors. That's why there should not be an instance of CMemorySystem in the
class CKernel then. Because this may be error prone, a second instance of
CMemorySystem will be ignored, but this does not need to be the case in the
future.
