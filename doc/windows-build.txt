WINDOWS BUILD

This file describes, how Circle-based applications can be built on Windows.  There's two
ways to do this:

1. Using Windows based toolchains
2. Using the "Windows SubSystem for Linux"


Windows Based Toolchains
-------------------------

First you have to download and install the following software:

* Git for Windows (Complete package, with bash support)
  from: https://gitforwindows.org
* GNU make for Windows (Complete package, except sources, Setup)
  from: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm
* Toolchain
  from: https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/ \
	developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads
  (e.g. gcc-arm-none-eabi-9-2020-q2-update-win32.exe, Windows Installer)

Then create a file \Users\Your Name\.bash_profile with this contents:

	export "PATH=$PATH:/c/Program Files (x86)/GnuWin32/bin"
	export "PATH=$PATH:/c/Program Files (x86)/path/to/toolchain/bin"

Insert the path to the toolchain in the second line. Now open "Git Bash" from
the Windows start menu and enter:

	cd ~/Documents
	git clone https://github.com/rsta2/circle.git
	cd circle
	echo "RASPPI = 3" > Config.mk
	./makeall -j
	cd sample/21-webserver
	make

This clones the Circle project and builds the sample/21-webserver for the
Raspberry Pi 3.


Windows Sub-System for Linux
----------------------------

Windows 10 includes support for the Windows Sub-System for Linux (WSL) which lets you run 
various Linux distributions on top of windows.  

This is similar to using a virtual machine but more efficient and better intergrated. It 
provides an excellent development environment for Circle-based projects because you can
use a full Linux environment for building and a Windows based IDE for editing.

This approach is known to work well with WSL v1.0, Ubuntu 20.04 from the Windows Store and 
the recommended Circle tool chain as per the [main readme file](/readme.md). 

For instructions on installing WSL and a Linux distro, see here: 

	https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10

If you want to use a serial port to communicate with the Pi, you must use WSL v1 as serial 
ports currently aren't supported with WSL v2. In the above linked article you can ignore 
everything about installing v2.  If you have a WSL v2 distro installed you can easily revert 
it to v1 as described here:

	https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WSL/issues/590

To access the serial ports from within the Linux machine use the device name `/dev/ttyS<n>` where
`<n>` is the COM port number.  eg: COM3 is available as `/dev/ttsS3`.  

To access an SD card attached to the Windows machine (ie: to copy kernel images to it), from the 
Linux machine first create a mount point for it:

	sudo mkdir /mnt/sdcard

You can then mount the card and copy to it: (replace d: with the Windows drive letter of the card)

	sudo mount -t drvfs d: /mnt/sdcard
	cp kernel7.img /mnt/sdcard
	sudo umount /mnt/sdcard

Alternatively instead of accessing Windows from the Linux side you can do the reverse.  Files on 
the Linux machine are accessible via a network share `\\wsl$\<machinename>` so you can pick up 
built kernel images from there and copy to the SD Card using Windows, or flash to the bootloader
using flasher.py on Windows.  If you take this approach you can use WSL v2.

For code editing, VS Code can run on Windows and directly edit files on the Linux machine.  See here 
for instructions on setting it up:
