BOOTLOADER

The Circle project has an integrated serial bootloader, which can be used to
speed-up the development process and to make it more comfortable. The bootloader
has been adapted from the well-known bootloader by David Welch.

To use the bootloader, you have to do the following:

1. You need a serial USB adapter (3.3V level) connected to GPIO14/15 (Broadcom
numbering) of your Raspberry Pi computer on one side and to your development
machine on the other.

2. On your development machine there must be a python3 interpreter (including the
python3-pyserial module) installed. You may also need the terminal program
"putty".

3. Add the following lines to the file Config.mk in the Circle root directory:

	SERIALPORT = /dev/ttyUSB0	(device of your serial USB adapter)
	FLASHBAUD = 115200		(baud rate for loading the application)
	USERBAUD = 115200		(baud rate used by the application)

By increasing FLASHBAUD you can speed-up to loading process very much. It
depends on your serial adapter, which baud rates are possible. Common values are
460800, 921600 or higher.

USERBAUD is the baud rate, used by the application itself, if it communicates
using the serial interface.

4. The Circle project libraries used in your application have to be build
manually using "./makeall" as described in the main README.md file.

5. You have to prepare a SD card, which starts your Raspberry Pi in bootloader
mode. Go to the boot/ subdirectory and enter:

	make all

After completion copy the files from boot/ to the SD card (copy the file
"config.txt" only for AArch64 operation), which must have a FAT partition.
Please note, that you have to repeat this step, if you change the parameter
FLASHBAUD in Config.mk. The built bootloader is specific for this baud rate. Put
the SD card into your Raspberry Pi, which is connected to your development
machine and power it on.

6. The bootloader starts when you go to the subdirectory of your application (or
sample program) in a shell and enter:

	make flash

7. If your application uses the serial interface itself, you can start the
terminal program "putty" directly from the shell. You have to enter "make
monitor" like you have done for "flash" before and putty should open with the
right communication parameters.
