README

To use this sample program you need a RTK.GPIO board allowing you to increase the number of GPIO pins.
RTK.GPIO board uses USB to serial IC Winchiphead CH341/CH340 to communicate to Raspberry Pi.
The board must be connected to an USB port of the Raspberry Pi and ready when the Raspberry Pi is started.

First blink 5 times to show the image was loaded right.
After initializing the USB driver stack the sample program first toggles the level of a single GPIO output
a couple of times (can be connected to a LED).
Afterwards, another GPIO pin configured as input samples the level (can be connected to a button).
