<B><I>fMSX</I></B> is a program that emulates MSX, MSX2, and MSX2+ home
computers. It runs the majority of MSX software and mimics most popular
hardware extensions, such as SCC, OPLL, etc. You can always get the latest
fMSX source code, binaries, and support files from

<P>
<B><I>fMSX</I></B> has a very long history for a piece of software. It has
been in continuous development since 1993, when I wrote the first version
to run on Unix-based DEC Alpha workstations. Because fMSX is written in C,
it is a very portable program. It can run on any sufficiently fast 32bit
hardware platform, be it personal computer, PDA, videogame console, cell
phone, set-top box, or a DVD player. There are fMSX versions for Unix,
Windows, Macintosh, Symbian, MSDOS, Amiga, and many other platforms.

<P>
fMSX source code is open for everyone to see but it is <U>not</U> in public
domain. You <U>can</U> look and learn from it, but you <U>cannot</U> change
it or copy it without giving a credit to the original author and a few other
conditions. If you would like to port fMSX to another platform or make
changes to the code, <U>please</U>, contact me by email or some other means.

<P>
<B><I>MSX</I></B> is an old 8bit family of home computers created in
1982 as an attempt to establish a single standard in home computing similar
to VHS in video. MSX computers have been popular in Asia (Korea, Japan) and
South America (Brazil, Chile) as well as in Europe (Netherlands, France,
Spain) and former Soviet Union, although they are virtually unknown in the
USA. Although the MSX platform quietly died around 1988, the world got to
see MSX2, MSX2+, and TurboR extensions of the MSX platform. 
</P>

<P>
The MSX has been mainly designed by a Japanese company called
<A HREF="http://www.ascii.co.jp/">ASCII</A> in cooperation with
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</A>, who provided the
firmware BASIC for the machine. There is a widespread rumor that "MSX"
stands for "MicroSoft eXtended". MSX machines were produced by such giants
as Sony, Yamaha, Panasonic, Toshiba, Daewoo, and Philips. The only MSX
model ever sold in the US appears to be an early SpectraVideo machine
though. 
</P>

<P>
In spite of its short history, MSX is a very nice computer, especially
good for education, as seen in an example of the Soviet Union. Soviet
Ministry of Education bought hundreds of MSXes (and later MSX2s) grouped
into "computerized classroom systems" of 10-16 machines connected with
a simple network. A whole generation of programmers has grown up using
these computers. 
</P>

<P>
Hardware-wise, MSX represents a hybride of a videogame console and a
generic CP/M-80 machine. Its heart is a Z80 CPU running at 3.58MHz in the
base model. The clock frequency has been doubled in the TurboR. The video
subsystem is built around a TI9918 or TI9928 VDP chip also used in Texas
Instruments' TI-99/4 computers, ColecoVision, and Coleco Adam. In the
late MSX models, this chip has been upgraded to V9938 (MSX2) and then to
V9958 (MSX2+ and TurboR). The latest version of this chip is known as V9990.
The audio system is handled by an AY-3-8910 chip from General Instruments,
same as the one used in Sinclair ZX Spectrum 128. AY-3-8910 provides three
channels of melodic sound, a noise channel, volume envelopes, and two
general purpose parallel IO ports, which MSX uses for joysticks and a few
other things. Due to their hardware architecture, MSX machines were
perfectly suitable for games and there was a lot of good games either
written for or ported to them.

<H1>Registered Users</H1>
<P>
  If you've registered fMSX-Windows, <U>please</U> do not give your copy to
anybody. And I do mean <U>anybody</U>. There were cases when registered
users gave fMSX away to their friends, relatives, or just some shady
characters on the Net, and then I found it pirated, put onto the Web, and
even <U>posted</U> to USENET newsgroups. If I find your personalized copy
of fMSX being spread around, your registration gets automatically cancelled
which means no support and no more updates.
</P>
<P>
  I understand that the previous paragraph may sound threatening to some
people, but this kind of piracy really hurts my profits and feelings. I've
put a lot of effort into fMSX, and can only continue working on it if
people do not try to cheat on me.

</P>
<LI><B>What are the .ROM files included with fMSX?</B>
<P>
  Following .ROM files may not be normal cartridges, but they are used by
fMSX:
<FONT COLOR="#000060">

</PRE>
</FONT>
Please note that not all of these may be included with your fMSX copy.
</P>
<LI><B>How do I use disks with fMSX?</B>
<P>
  fMSX includes disk support starting with version 0.9. If you have an
earlier version, you cannot use disks. The following instructions assume
that you have a version supporting disks. 
</P>
<P>
  First, make sure that the DISK.ROM file containing MSX DiskROM is in
the current directory. Then, use an MSDOS program called DCOPY.EXE to
create disk images of your MSX disks: 
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><CODE>DCOPY &lt;drive&gt;: &lt;filename&gt;.DSK</CODE></P>
<P>
  These images are just raw files with all disk blocks written in a
sequence. They can also be created on a Unix machine with
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><CODE>cp /dev/rfd0 &lt;filename&gt;.DSK</CODE></P>
<P>
or a similar command. If you have a 1.44MB HD floppy formatted on MSX for
720kB, don't forget to stick a piece of tape on the HD/DD indicator hole. 
</P>
<P>
  After you have created disk image files, run fMSX in the following way:
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<CODE>fmsx -diska &lt;filename1&gt;.DSK -diskb &lt;filename2&gt;.DSK</CODE>
</P>
<P>
where two image filenames will become your drives A: and B:. You can also
have default disk images called DRIVEA.DSK and DRIVEB.DSK and located in
the current directory. 
</P>
<LI><B>Is there an easier way to work with disk images?</B>
<P>
  In fact, there is. Look at two programs that come with fMSX, called
<CODE>wrdsk</CODE> and <CODE>rddsk</CODE>. The <CODE>wrdsk</CODE> program
allows you to create a disk image and add files to it:
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<CODE>wrdsk &lt;filename&gt;.DSK &lt;file&gt; &lt;file&gt; ...</CODE>
</P>
<P>
  The <CODE>rddsk</CODE> program will read files from a given disk image:
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<CODE>
rddsk &lt;filename&gt;.DSK [-d &lt;dir&gt;] [&lt;file&gt; &lt;file&gt; ...]
</CODE>
</P>
<LI><B>I can't get some BASIC programs to work with the emulator.</B>
<P>
  Many MSX programs have BASIC loaders written for machines not quite
compatible with each other. Other loaders expect the machine to have
only one floppy disk drive and use the memory dedicated to the second
drive. To make such programs work, perform two "magic passes" on fMSX
before running a loader:
<UL>
<LI>When booting MSX, press <CODE>[CTRL]+[DEL]</CODE> keys to switch off
    the second disk drive.
<LI>Before running a program, type <CODE>POKE &amp;hFFFF,&amp;hAA</CODE>
    to set MSX memory manager into the mode expected by most loaders.
</UL> 
</P>
<LI><B>I can't get some ROM images to work with the emulator.</B>
<P>
  If the ROM image is bigger than 32kB, try using <CODE>-rom &lt;N&gt;</CODE>
parameter with different <CODE>&lt;N&gt;</CODE>s (see <CODE>fmsx -help</CODE>
for a complete list). If you still can't get ROM image to work, send it to me
for analysis. 
</P>
<LI><B>Is it legal to spread cartridge ROMs?</B>
<P>
  <U>NO</U>. Nobody seems to care though, mainly because there is no profit
to be made from MSX software any longer. Nevertheless, be aware of the fact
that by using commercial software you haven't bought you are commencing an
act of piracy.
</P>
<LI><B>When compiling fMSX-Unix, I get "undefined name" errors.</B>
<P>
  This means that your linker cannot find the libraries necessary for the
emulator (namely, libX11.a and libXext.a) or some additional libraries
(like libsocket.a and libnsl.a) are required. Find these libraries in your
system and modify the Makefile so that the final invocation of the C
compiler has <CODE>-L&lt;path_to_libs&gt;</CODE> options. If you have no
libXext.a library, try #undefining <CODE>MITSHM</CODE> option. 
</P>
<LI><B>When starting fMSX-Unix, I get X_ShmAttach error.</B>
<P>
  You are probably trying to run the emulator on a remote Xterminal while
it attempts to use shared memory for interfacing with X. Use the
<CODE>-noshm</CODE> option to disable the shared memory usage.
</P>
<LI><B>The emulation starts under Unix, but then I get X_PutImage error.</B>
<P>
  Unix/X version of fMSX can currently be compiled for 8bit, 16bit, or
32bit Xterminals. Neither 1bit nor 4bit Xterminals will work with the
drivers included into official fMSX distribution. Arnold Metselaar
developed the drivers supporting any Xterminal. These drivers are
available from the fMSX

Working on Amiga port, Hans has done a very good job in getting fMSX run
fast on an Amiga. He rewrote the CPU emulation and the screen drivers in
assembler, optimized the VDP emulation, wrote sound drivers, and added
many more things making fMSX-Amiga the best, if not the fastest MSX
emulator for this platform. Thanks, Hans (and yes, I do remember those
.ROM files too ;)).
<P>
<DT><B>Igor Sharfmesser [.KZ] and Alex Krasivsky [.RU]</B>
<DD>
Igor and Alex have brought to life fMSX-MSDOS. The first version,
including screen and keyboard drivers, was done by Igor. AdLib
sound was added by Alex.
<P>
<DT><B>Teturo Tokuyama [.JP]</B>
<DD>
Teturo has done an excellent port of fMSX to Windows. As much as
I hate Windows, I must admit that Teturo's fMSX-Win32 rules.
Period.
<P>
<DT><B>Murakami Reki [.JP]</B>
<DD>
Murakami has written PC9801 port of fMSX. He is the guy whom you
have to thank for the disk support in fMSX. If not for him, I
would have never started implementing it :).
<P>
<DT><B>Marcel de Kogel [.NL]</B>
<DD>
Marcel wrote an excellent port of fMSX to MSDOS. His MSDOS version
of fMSX was actually the first one that supported all fMSX features
correctly. Marcel also provided invaluable help debugging and
improving fMSX and other emulators.
<P>
<DT><B>Ville Hallik [.EE]</B>
<DD>
AY8910 and SCC chips emulation, written by Ville for Linux/FreeBSD
/dev/dsp device, and SunOS /dev/audio, was the best fMSX sound
emulation I have seen at the time. And, yes, it lets you play
MSX games with sound on a Unix system! =:)
<P>
<DT><B>John Stiles [.US]</B>
<DD>
John took over the development of the Macintosh version of fMSX
and managed to speed up the common part of display drivers used
in the Unix/X, MSDOS, Windows, and Macintosh versions.
<P>
<DT><B>Paul Chapman [.CA]</B>
<DD>
Paul Chapman is the original author of fMSX-Macintosh. Although his
port had bugs, it looked great and ran faster than the original MSX
computer on an average PPC-based Macintosh of that time. As Paul was
not able to continue developing fMSX-Macintosh, the development has
been taken over by John Stiles.
<P>
<DT><B>Arnold Metselaar [.NL]</B>
<DD>
If you happen to have a non-standard X11 display, get Arnold's X11
drivers fixed to work for any screen depth. Arnold has also added
to his drivers a lot of improvements that are not in the standard
fMSX distribution. Make sure to check out his work.
<P>
<DT><B>Guenter Woigk [.DE]</B>
<DD>
Found a bug with offsets in Z80 commands using IX/IY registers.
<P>
<DT><B>Martial Benoit [.FR]</B>
<DD>
Explained how VDP deals with sprites and sent me copies of V9938
and WD2793 databooks (WOW! Thanks, Martial :)).
<P>
<DT><B>Sean Young [.NL]</B>
<DD>
For finally making it clear to me how GameMaster2 SRAM works and also for
finding a bug in my Konami4 mapper emulation.
<P>
<DT><B>Alex Wulms [.NL]</B>
<DD>
Alex has written the most accurate emulation of the V9938 graphical
operations to date. This emulation is now a part of fMSX. Also, Alex
explained to me a lot of technical details of VDP operation. And he
sent me a copy of the WD1793 databook :).
<P>
<DT><B>Maarten ter Huurne [.NL]</B>
<DD>
Maarten has done extensive bug-hunting on things that I would never
consider to run (that is, demos :)). He also looks for glitches in games
and doesn't rest until he gets to the source of a problem. Additionally,
he has implemented MSX Serial I/O emulation that is slowly making its
way into fMSX. And finally (as the stuff above were not enough) you can
thank Maarten and Takamichi Suzukawa for the English translation of the
Konami's Solid Snake cartridge!
<P>
<DT><B>Miguel Colom [.ES]</B>
<DD>
Miguel has come up with an idea and the code to use directories as if 
they were MSX disks.
</DL>
<P>
...and to all other people who helped me with advice, information, and
encouragment.
