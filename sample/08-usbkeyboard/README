First blink 5 times to show the image was loaded right. After initializing the
USB host controller the USB hub driver detects all attached USB devices and
displays its identifiers (vendor, device and interface).

The new feature in this step is the support for USB keyboards. Just type on the
keyboard and your input will be echoed to the screen.

Because this sample is enabled for USB plug-and-play, the USB keyboard can be
attached or removed at any time while or before the system is running. It will
be detected automatically and can be used, if it is attached. On the Raspberry
Pi 1-3 and Zero the system option USE_USB_SOF_INTR should be defined in the file
include/circle/sysconfig.h to use this sample program.

In "cooked mode" (used by default) a keyboard translation map is used to
translate the physical key code into the right ASCII code or in an escape
sequence for special keys (see the file doc/keyboard.txt). There are six of
these language-depended maps at the moment (UK English, Spanish, French,
Italian, US International and German). Select the wanted map at the end of the
file include/circle/sysconfig.h before building (defaUlt map) or by using the
file cmdline.txt (e.g. "keymap=UK"). The "Caps Lock" and "Num Lock" keys should
work as expected. If you press Ctrl-Alt-Del the system reboots.

In "raw mode" the physical key codes of the pressed keys are send to the
key-pressed handler. To test this please change the #if in CKernel::Run() in the
file kernel.cpp. You can also use it to discover to physical key codes if you
want to construct your own keymap (file lib/input/keymap_??.h). Note that it
depends on the keyboard how many keys it can detect simultaneous (maximum is 6).
