For using USB touchscreens see below!

This sample shows the touch events generated by the official Raspberry Pi touch
screen. The touch screen driver does not know, if the touch screen is really
there. That's why the sample normally starts successfully with other displays,
but you will not get touch events then.

The official Raspberry Pi touch screen must be connected as described here:

https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/the-eagerly-awaited-raspberry-pi-display/

After 5 blinks of the Act LED and the initialization the sample waits for touch
events. Just touch the screen with one or more fingers (up to ten), move them on
the screen or remove them from it. The touch screen driver should generate the
appropriate events then, which will be displayed by the sample on the screen.


This sample supports a number of touchscreens with USB interface too. Only
touchscreens with standard USB HID-class interface in digitizer mode are
supported here. You may have to run the tool in tools/touchscreen-calibrator/
before to get real screen coordinates with this sample.
